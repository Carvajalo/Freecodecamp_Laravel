// Description: test.js
// where n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 are integers 
// I want to calculate one possible combination of f(x) = 0.1 ( n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 ) + 0.2 * n5 = x
// where x is a random number between 0 and 1
// I want to calculate the probability of getting a combination of n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 that gives me x
